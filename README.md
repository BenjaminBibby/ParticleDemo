# ParticleDemo
A demonstration of my particle system for Android devices. The project was original thought of as a native Android(Java) application, but for the sake of learning Xamarin, I've decided to make it a Xamarin C# project instead. The project is based on a set of designpatterns; mainly ThreadPool and ObjectPool, where multiple particles can spawn and handled at the same time.
